/**
 * What the Xcode target calls, and the whole of what Swift has to know about this app.
 *
 * `MainActivity` and `NodysseyApp` are the Android counterparts and both are synchronous; this one
 * takes a callback, and the reason is [resolveWebKitUserAgent]. The `User-Agent` this app sends has
 * to be the one WebKit sends, or a `cf_clearance` earned in the sign-in browser is rejected on the
 * very next API call — and WebKit will only say what its user agent is by running a line of
 * JavaScript, which is asynchronous. So the graph is built after that answer arrives rather than
 * around a guess, and the launch screen stays up for the milliseconds it takes.
 *
 * **Built once per process, not once per call**, and both halves of that matter:
 *
 * - The container owns a Room database and six DataStore files. A second instance over the same
 *   files is not a duplicate, it is a corruption: DataStore raises `IllegalStateException` the moment
 *   two of them serve one file in one process.
 * - The controller holds the composition, and the composition holds the navigation back stack.
 *   Rebuilding it puts the reader back on the feed.
 *
 * Neither is hypothetical. A scene is disconnected and reconnected by the system — backgrounding
 * this app and returning to it does exactly that — and `scene(_:willConnectTo:)` calls this each
 * time. The first version of this shell built a fresh graph on every one of them, and the way that
 * showed was a post detail screen that had become the feed while the app was in the background.
 *
 * `UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes` is false, which is what makes one controller the right
 * number: reusing a view controller across two live scenes would not be.
 *
 * @param onReady called on the main thread with the controller to install as the window's root.
