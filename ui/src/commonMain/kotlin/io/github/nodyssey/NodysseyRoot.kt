 * This is the whole of what a platform shell has to call: on Android that is `MainActivity`, which
 * since step D1 does nothing but resolve the intent it was started with and hand the result over.
 * Keeping the theme here rather than there is what lets the five theme helpers below stay `internal`
 * to this module — a shell that reaches into `ui.settings.theme` to build a `ColorScheme` is a shell
 * that has opinions about the app.
 *
 * @param initialSettings what the store held when the shell asked, before this composition existed,
 * or null if it could not get an answer. The one thing a shell is asked to fetch itself, because the
 * store answers asynchronously and the first frame cannot wait for it without going out in the
 * factory colours. Required rather than defaulted: a shell that forgets it is a shell that flashes.
